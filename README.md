# Credit-card fraud detection
I have done some exploratory data analysis and visualization on the data. Since this is a highly unbalanced dataset , I have used under-sampling to make balanced dataset for model training .I have used various algorithms and in the end I found Random Forest to be the most effective. Thus I have used it as the model for doing the final testing on the dataset.
Figures after testing the Random forest model on the test set.
1. Accuracy - 93.93 %
2. Precision - 95.23%
3. Recall- 86.96%
4. F1-score - 90.90 %
